# tensorflow-intro
My notes about TensorFlow introduction course

## Contents
* [Very basic intro](/basic-intro.md) : A very basic introduction concepts on Machine Learning and Deep learning Neural Networks. 
* [Basic Tensorflow functions](/basic-tf-functions.md): A very basic `TensorFlow` methods to create a basic Neural Network using keras.
* [Keras Callbacks](/keras-callbacks.md): You can define a callback that will be invoked during training your NN when an event occurs.
* [Convultational Neural Network Intro](/convulational-networks.md): We add some layers to our NN in order to apply some filters called `Convulations`. We can reduce our data applying `Pooling`
